## SELF EXTRACT builder


</div>

### Description

This is a self extract builder.

It only creates an .exe, no other things!

But before you use it, READ LICENSE.TXT

I would appreciate that :)

This is made in some minutes so the code is not optimized.

It's something to learn from!

Thanks!

Alex, Flex Software
